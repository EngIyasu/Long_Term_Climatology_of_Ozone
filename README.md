# Long_Term_Climatology_of_Ozone
This GitHub repository is consisting of two Python Jupyter Notebooks. The first part "Ozone_Data_Acquisition_and_processing" notebook acquires and manipulates the hourly raw ozone data from the pre-generated files of dataset available at US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It automatically requests, acquires, and process the raw zipped data from EPA website and saves the processed and filtered data in CSV format for further statistical analysis presented in part two of this repository. The second part "Ozone_Long_Term_Climatology" notebook presents the long-term climatology study of ozone in the City of Houston, Texas, United States, from January 2005 to December 2019 by utilizing different statistical analysis methods on the hourly data acquired through part one notebook.

This repository is prepared as part of my activity at 2020 Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) workshop organized by Howard University.
